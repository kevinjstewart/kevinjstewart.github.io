### My favourite artists and albums

[Your Blues - Destroyer](https://open.spotify.com/album/2UsZRzjcrSpd5NyBdLoC4Y)

Absolute masterpiece. Such a unique sound with the midi sounds but at the same time so expressive and almost pious in a way. The bridge in *Don't Become the Thing You Hated* is just so good.

[Rubies - Destroyer](https://open.spotify.com/album/45xFWdfYE1s7zpenU78U0b)

"Cast myself towards infinity; trust me I had my reasons"

[Down There - Avey Tare](https://open.spotify.com/album/69P8hRo1OufYkvo67k9b39)

I find this to be a very engrossing album, the atmosphere is just so melancholy. It's like you're travelling down the river styx but it's in the middle of a swamp. Even though this album can be so sad, *Lucky 1* is the light at the end of the tunnel.

[Arca - Arca](https://open.spotify.com/album/1MQO4j8QExVgmnplbIodEU)

Arca is truly a master at creating music with true passion.

[Pet Sounds - The Beach Boys](https://open.spotify.com/album/1yMPDqzYuQ4TI10ICKlbzW)

Universally loved, critically acclaimed masterpiece of an album. Dated yet modern.

[Virgins - Tim Hecker](https://open.spotify.com/track/2tUg06jgbqtxJUbNAx23M4)

I don't even know why I like this so much, but I suspect it may be the atmosphere created here along with the album art. Mystifying.

[Always Returning - Brian Eno (song)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1ps5sx71OhHiBVmGiKQSne)

Electronic but yet so human.

[Slippi - Animal Collective (song)](https://open.spotify.com/track/5Gb60ANPHgzkZhU2HToLpd)

Very fun high-energy song.
